                <p>Throughout the course, you have learned various web development techniques, from HTML &amp; CSS to
                    JavaScript, as well as design theories like spacing and positioning. Now you have all the tools you
                    need to make a website. Your goal for this project is to make any kind of website you want. It's all
                    up to your creativity!</p>

            </div>

            <!-- Body starts here -->
            <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
            <p><strong>This is an individual project.</strong></p>
            <p>You must create a fully functional website. By fully functional, we only mean fully functional on the
                front-end. This means that you might not have logins, signups, or commenting features that require
                back-end implementation, but everything else should work, i.e. when you click on any button or link, it
                should do something.</p>
            <h4 id="to-see-examples-of-past-student-projects-click-herehttpwebdesigndecalgithubioshowcase">To see
                examples of past student projects, click <a href="http://webdesigndecal.github.io/showcase">here</a>.
            </h4>
            <h3 id="views">Views</h3>
            <p>You must create at least <strong>two (2) views</strong>. This may not necessarily be two pages: You can
                have a one-page layout, with at least 2 separate sections, each with different content and layout.</p>
            <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
            <p>Your project will need <strong>two (2) features</strong> of some significance. We want them to serve some
                purpose on your website, rather than being placeholders because we ask you to put them there. Each
                feature can range from unique animations, interactive things done in JavaScript. We encourage you to
                diversify these features; pseudo-selector like <code>:hover</code> effects will only count as
                <strong>one feature</strong>. Examples of such features include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pseudo-selectors -- don't overdo this as we count them once &#x1F52E;</li>
                <li>A cool CSS animation -- something beyond a bouncing basketball? You may have a loading animation
                    &#x1F3A1;</li>
                <li>An image carousel or slider -- you may code it yourself from scratch or learn an existing JavaScript
                    library to achieve this &#x1F3A0;</li>
                <li>An interactive button in JavaScript (perhaps a play-now button that takes the player to the game
                    mode from the menu page, note that a button taking the player back to the menu from can count as a
                    different feature) -- some folks made games as their final projects &#x1F47E;</li>
                <li>Something in 3D if you're feeling experimental -- think of a rotating wireframe ball/cube spinning
                    on your page?! &#x1F381;</li>
                <li>Anything else you can think of &#x1F4A1;</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>If you're unsure if your ideas will count towards these <strong>features</strong>, come talk to WDD
                    staff before/during the project check-in</em> &#x1F603;</p>
            <h3 id="responsive-design">Responsive Design</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Your website must support following web browsers and screen resolutions,</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Web Browser: Chrome, Safari, Firefox</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Screen Resolution: 1024x768 ~ 1440x900;<br />
                                even better if the page layout's mobile compatible (optional)</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>As long as you stick to these requirements, you can make anything you want!</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="write-up">Write-up</h3>
            <p>Please create a separate PDF document that lists out and describes your <strong>two (2) most significant
                    features</strong> (like a treasure map &#x1F5FA; so we can find them). Please also tell us about the
                <strong>significance and purpose</strong> of each of those features.
            </p>
            <p>You'll only need to write a few short sentences about each feature, and finally <strong>attach this
                    write-up to the <a href="https://forms.gle/x5M3nXah2EkuYEhM9" target="_blank">project submission
                        form</a></strong>.</p>
            <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Check-in: <strong>4 points</strong></p>
                    <p>Just like the group project, there will be a check-in with the staff to review your current
                        progress and give you feedback on your final project. Please come prepared with mockups for each
                        of your pages. If you do not have mockups for both views and/or you do not check-in your project
                        on time, you will not receive full credit. We highly encourage you come with some HTML skeleton
                        code, but it is not required for the check-in.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>UI Aesthetics: <strong>10 points</strong></p>
                    <p>We will be judging the design of your website; in particular, spacing, color, typography &amp;
                        images, and positioning.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>User Experience: <strong>10 points</strong></p>
                    <p>We will also look at how the interface enhances the usability of your website. For example, if
                        you have an image heavy website, grid UI might be better than using a straightforward list UI.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Significant features: <strong>6 points</strong></p>
                    <p>There should be at least <strong>two (2) features</strong> on the website. They can be
                        implemented using CSS and JavaScript. <strong>Again, only one pseudo-selector can count towards
                            this requirement.</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Write-up: <strong>2 points</strong></p>
                    <p>As a friendly reminder, we ask that you identify these features in a separate write-up and
                        explain their significant and purpose, similar to how you did in the group project. If you have
                        any questions about what constitutes as a feature, let us know! Otherwise, Please attach this
                        write-up as a PDF to the project submission form.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Total: 32 points</strong></p>

                    <p>Your project is due on November 29th at 11:59 PM PST. This is so that we have enough time to look
                        over your submissions and choose the top submissions for the final presentation. We will notify
                        you the next day if your project has been selected.</p>

                            top 3 projects to be showcased in the <a

            <h2 id="using-online-resources">Using Online Resources</h2>
            <p>Here are some rules regarding the use of online resources. If you have a question of whether something is
                acceptable or not, don't hesitate to ask.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are not allowed to use templates like premade themes for Wordpress and Tumblr.</li>

                <li>EXCEPTION: The use of JavaScript libraries (e.g. waypoints, masonry) is okay.</li>
            </ul>
